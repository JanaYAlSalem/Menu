<li><h3> Description of project:</h3></li>
We have a menu with 4 options (Contact Us – Setting – Login – logout )
In this project, it is for trying the menu only. So, Contact Us is not working now, but when the user selects the * Setting * will be moved to another page called Setting Page, the last two options depend on swapping where the user is.
This means when a user is in Login the menu will be shown the options without login. And so on in logout.
